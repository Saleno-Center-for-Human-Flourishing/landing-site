### Course Description

This course, PHIL 1700, invites students to explore enduring philosophical questions and to reflectively evaluate the various answers given them by thinkers from a range of social, historical, and religious contexts. Students will tackle ultimate questions in a range of philosophical domains, including issues such as the nature of self and ultimate reality, morality and human meaning, rationality and the pursuit of truth. The aim of the course is to give students an opportunity to critically examine their own beliefs and commitments in dialogue with each other and with great thinkers past and present. (Offered Fall, Spring, and Summer)

## Communication

Students can expect to:

1.	respond to questions/problems within 48 hours.
2.	log into the course 5 out of 7 days a week; and
3.	provide continued grade statuses throughout the semester using either a calculated column in the grade book or a report sent through email.


### Discord

Discord and email are my preferred methods of communication. I am on Discord during workday hours, though I may be “away” during meetings and while I attend to other business. I also may have limited availability between 8-4:30pm. I will also monitor Discord during weekday evening hours and will respond to messages if I am able. Likewise, I dedicate time to email responses each workday, meaning that my response time is typically within 24 hours during the workweek. Please use your LC email account when emailing me. For both email and Discord, if you have not received a response from me after 48 hours (or by end of business on Monday if you messaged me over the weekend), please follow-up to ensure that your message did not get lost in the shuffle.

All messages regarding course updates, assignments, and changes to the class schedule, including cancellations, will be posted on the _news channel in Discord. Changes to the class schedule, including cancellations, will also sent to your LC email account. It is imperative that you check both Slack and your SLU email account regularly.

Please also ensure that all concerns or questions about your standing in the course are directed to me immediately. Inquires from parents, SLU staff members, and others will not be honored.

### Virtual Meeting Policy:

By participating in our live events, you are acknowledging awareness that, depending on your involvement, your name, voice, comments, and likeness may be recorded and shared with other L&C students and faculty. If you are uncomfortable participating with these acknowledgements, please contact your course instructor for alternate arrangements.

### Course Outcomes, Objectives, and Competencies

Some Helpful Resources

[Philpapers](philpapers.org) provides a helpful overview of the field. The home page does a beautiful job of mapping the relationships between various philosophers and disciplines within philosophy. My search algorithm is likely going to be vastly different than yours.

Another helpful resource includes [Stanford's Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/). If you search up almost any philosophical question followed by “sep”, you may likely find a link to an article on this page with an extensive development and critical reflection of that question. However, because of individualized algorithmic searches, individual results may vary.

Sometimes I will post videos from [WiPhi](www.wi-phi.com). Be aware however, the maintainers of this site have thus far failed to update their transfer protocol. You will likely receive a warning against continuing to the site. Perhaps it is better to avoid this resource until they fix this issue.

If you have ever worried about media bias etc., [AllSides](https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news) scores the various media publications according to potential bias. This will be helpful since we will be looking at some articles about contentious issues and consider whether we are influenced by the truth of a claim, or by persuasive speech.

## Evaluation and Grading

Much of the learning that you do in this course will be done at home. What this means, is that instead of applying what have learned in the classroom at home, working on a problem, writing a paper, etc., you will instead apply what you have learned at home, in the classroom. I will provide ample opportunity for you to apply in class what you have learned at home. This includes assignments, discussion participation, reading feedback (i.e., this reading was difficult because . . .). Each of these aspects will together comprise your grade in the course. Ultimately, what you learn, and the grade you will receive, will be up to you. You will get as much out of this course as you put in.

Both attendance and participation are critically important aspects of this course. The course participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during discussions and group exercises, (c) level of engagement on discord, and (d) the completion of other exercises including “entry” and “exit” tickets, the student information sheet, a pre-test, and an end of the semester course evaluation.

Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit. This scale is available to you at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g140Jx843x7aekG5fe8zyVbwymVSW8Rd-I3BX4VvqMI/edit?usp=sharing.

Your participation grade will be a cumulation of the points you’ve earned on each of the assignments, plus those points you earned through participation and attendance.

## Attendance Policy

Attendance and participation are important components of this course since we only meet once a week. Students are expected to attend all class sessions; missing even one class can create a significant roadblock for many students. If you cannot attend class or arrive on time because of a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me beforehand to let me know.

I may ask for more information, such as a note from a physician, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for absences. A penalty will not be applied to your first unexcused absence or late arrival. Any absences or late arrivals beyond the first will result in no credit (for an absences) or only partial credit (for a late arrival) being earned for that day’s participation grade. Making up missed classes are your responsibility. I do post slide decks on the course website, but my slides are intended only to serve as references.

## Academic Honesty

In the event of an unexpected campus closure or delayed start, course requirements, deadlines and grading percentages are subject to change when necessitated by revised course delivery, semester calendar or other circumstances. Information about changes in this course can be obtained on the Blackboard course homepage or by contacting my email address: xxxx@lc.edu or office phone/cell xxx-xxx-xxxx. If the course is not able to meet face-to-face, students should immediately log onto L&C Blackboard, https://blackboard.lc.edu, and read any announcements and/or alternative assignments. Students are also encouraged to continue the readings and other assignments as outlined on this syllabus or subsequent syllabi.

### L&C Policy on Academic Honesty: Cheating.

Intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids; use of any unauthorized assistance, resources, materials or electronic/cellular devices with or without photographic capability in taking quizzes, tests or examinations and the acquisition, without permission, of a test or other academic material belonging to Lewis & Clark Community College, to any department, or to any staff.

### Plagiarism:

Plagiarism at LCCC will not be tolerated. Plagiarism includes the reproduction of ideas, words or statements of another person as ones’ own without acknowledgement or use of an agency engaged in the selling of term papers or other academic materials. If instructor has reason to believe students are in violation of this policy, students will be notified and appropriate action will be taken.

### LCCC Plagiarism statement:

Assignments that have been copied from another student or another source will not be scored. “Academic dishonesty including, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, and forgery, violates the STUDENT CONDUCT CODE and will lead to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion”. The following website will give you in-depth information on the definition of plagiarism and more: http://www.plagiarism.org/article/what-is-plagiarism Please visit this site if you need clarification.

### Unauthorized Collaboration:

Unauthorized collaboration among students will not be tolerated. Unauthorized collaboration is defined as intentionally sharing or working together in an academic exercise when such actions are not approved by the course instructor. Academic exercises include but are not limited to all face-to-face and/or online classroom assignments, activities, exams, quizzes, worksheets, online discussion questions, term papers, case studies, projects, research, or any other requirement assigned by the instructor for which students receive individual grades. If the instructor has reason to believe students share or work together collaboratively on such academic exercises, the student(s) will be notified and at the minimum, receive a zero on the assignment.

### Facilitation of Academic Dishonesty:

Permitting or attempting to help another to violate the academic honor code; Alteration or sabotage of another student’s work, such as tampering with or modifying any online or written assignments including but not limited to quizzes, exams, worksheets, term papers, case studies, projects, research, discussion board entries, etc. If the instructor has reason to believe students facilitate academic dishonesty, the student(s) will be notified and appropriate action will be taken.

## Counseling

Counseling is by appointment and on an emergency walk-in basis. Visits are
confidential, free of charge, and include counseling for crisis intervention, brief therapy, academic issues, test anxiety, community resources, and referrals. Contacts: Brooke Frank: bfrank@lc.edu,

## Device Policy

During class periods, students are asked to refrain from using electronic devices (including cell phones) unless there is a documented need for it. If you take notes on your computer, then you can have it open. However for this course, I will expect you to take notes by hand. For this class, I expect students to limit their use of electronic devices to accessing course software, readings, and notes. There is evidence that using electronic devices during lectures results in decreased retention of course content (Hembrooke and Gay 2003) and lower overall course performance (Fried 2008). Students who are not using a laptop but are in direct view of another student’s laptop also have decreased performance in courses (Sana et al. 2013). Conversely, students who take notes the “old fashioned way” have better performance on tests compared to students who take notes on laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). I therefore ask students to be conscious of how they are using their devices, the ways such use impacts their own learning, and the effect that it may have on others around them. I reserve the right to alter this policy if electronic device use becomes problematic during the semester.
