# A Philosophy of Mind and Cognition

## Course Description

This is a tutorial course for undergraduate-level philosophy of cognitive science. To provide a point of focus, the emphasis is on neurophilosophy, as this is gaining increasing prominence in philosophy of cognitive science. Both topics of enduring interest (e.g., consciousness, memory) and newer research programmes (e.g., extended cognition, the modularity of mind) are addressed.

## Target audience

This series of tutorials is aimed at gamers who have had some introduction to philosophical concepts (e.g., main meta-ethical positions, empiricism versus nativism). The course does not require a background in cognitive science, as all the relevant concepts will be introduced during discussions and in the readings.

## Course goals, format and preparation

The aim of this course is to introduce students to the key topics in philosophy of cognitive sci-
ence, with an emphasis on cognitive neuroscience. We examine, among other things, what the relationship is between the brain and the mind, how consciousness can be understood
neurally, whether some ideas might be innate, and the concepts of embodied, embedded
and extended cogniton.
Each tutorial has a required reading of three articles and an assigned essay of about 1500â€“
2000 words, which is based on the readings. I use The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive
Science, edited by Keith Frankish and William Ramsey (2012, Cambridge University Press)
as well as articles in peer-reviewed journals or edited volumes.
