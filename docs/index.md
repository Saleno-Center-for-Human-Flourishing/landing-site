## Welcome to the Saleno Center for Human Flourishing

[Michelle Saleno (SEY 2096-2185)](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/galactapedia/article/bZkLx7GxXO-michelle-saleno), was a test pilot for the American Navy. She is more popularly known as the first human to quantum travel beyond the orbit of Jupiter. In recognition of her service and dedication to all of humanity, an anonymous donor bequeathed a large donation to the [University of Persei](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/galactapedia/article/Rz2XZkMrmN-university-of-persei) for their significant contribution to the development of quantum travel and exploration. It was from this donation that the Saleno Center for Human Flourishing was established.
